# List of public mass shootings from the beginning of the federal assault weapons ban
# Sept 13, 1994 to the end of December, 2018
# Inclusion in the data set requires that at least four people be killed in public
# places, and the incident was not associated with criminal activity or self-defense
# For transparency, we include some events that do not meet this criteria that have 
# been included in other past compilations of public mass shootings.  However, we
# flag such events in the meet_inclusion_criteria field.
